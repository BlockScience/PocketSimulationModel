# Pocket Network Simulation Model

## Summary

The enclosed repository serves as a simulation model for testing economic scenarios related to the Pocket Network. It is built off cadCAD under the hood.

## Model Background

Math spec connection

## Current Development

The current development updates are:

1. Majority of the core development for action chains are completed but there is still refinement needed in terms of constraints and non-basic behaviors.
2. Parameters are being filled in over time as all their relationships are filled in (sourced from the math spec for easily knowing where parameters need to be invoked).
3. Basic scenario creation tools implemented which allow for testing iteratively during development.
