    "- **Goal**: to understand the impact on servicer profitability of a change in the number of services available\n",
    "- **System Goals Targeted**:\n",
    "  - Economic Viability\n",
    "  - Long-Term Value Generation\n",
    "  - Accessibility\n",
    "- **Design**: create a stochastic model of servicer entry, conditional upon 1) the arrival of a new service (chain) into the ecosystem, 2) the response of applications to the arrival of a new service, and 3) the resulting profitability of a potential servicer entering the ecosystem\n",
    "- **Testing mechanism**:\n",
    "  - There is an arrival of a new service which initially has no servicers attached\n",
    "  - There is relay demand in response to this new service, potentially with some delay\n",
    "  - Servicers already in the ecosystem decide whether or not to relay to/from the new service\n",
    "  - If a servicer decides to connect to the new service, it may _disconnect_ from its lowest-profit service (no unstaking penalty if moving from one service to another)\n",
    "  - Potential servicers decide whether or not to enter the ecosystem\n",
    "  - Different block reward and fee structures are tested against the above\n",
